## data sources

# I am using two main data sources. The first is PIT and HIC count data from HUD. The specific data table used was created in excel by me. The second data sources comes from California's HDIS data and is directly queried from their website

```{r reading data}
PITdata <- read_excel("PIT count data 2019 to 2023.xlsx")

HDISdata <- read.csv("https://data.ca.gov/dataset/c7ed1ae4-4f93-4fc7-b603-3cd07a55d862/resource/b1a5ae24-5842-425c-b56c-aa90f8f1c767/download/homelessness-count-by-age.csv")
